        I'm a digital strategist with 25+ years of experience helping institutions and mission-driven teams simplify
        complex web platforms.
        At Kankakee Community College, I lead digital strategy for our public-facing web systems — including CMS
        architecture, accessibility
        compliance, and governance. My work sits at the intersection of technology, content, and policy.

      <p class="about__p">
        These sessions are built to give you what I deliver internally: a structured, calm path through digital
        complexity — so you can move
        forward with clarity, not confusion.
