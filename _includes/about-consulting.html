            <p class="about__p">I'm a digital strategist with 25+ years of experience helping institutions and mission-driven teams simplify their
                web platforms. I specialize in helping non-technical leaders gain clarity on their digital infrastructure—so they
                can move forward with confidence and without technical overhead.</p>
            
            <p class="about__p">At Kankakee Community College, I lead strategy for the institution's public web systems—focusing on CMS architecture,
                governance, accessibility, and tool integration. My approach is grounded in real-world operations and built for
                long-term sustainability.</p>
            
            <p class="about__p">These sessions are designed to give you exactly what I deliver internally: a calm, structured path forward through complex systems.</p>
