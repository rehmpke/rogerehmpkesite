            <p class="about__p">I’m a digital strategist with 25+ years of experience leading web systems, accessibility, and governance in higher ed
            and mission-driven environments.</p>
            
            <p class="about__p">At Kankakee Community College, I function as Director of Digital Strategy — guiding CMS architecture, cross-departmental
            governance, and compliance execution for both public and internal digital platforms. I collaborate with teams across
            Marketing, ITS, Foundation, and Student Services to ensure our systems are accessible, aligned with policy, and built
            for long-term sustainability.</p>
            
            <p class="about__p">I also work with small teams and nonprofit leaders to bring clarity to complex web platforms—reducing risk, avoiding
            tool sprawl, and building systems that serve people, not just technology.</p>

            <p class="about__p">Whether advising on accessibility, content strategy, or institutional compliance touchpoints, my work is built around
            one principle: clarity leads to trust.</p>
