          <p class="about__p">I'm a higher education web and digital strategy leader with more than 25 years of experience in UX, accessibility, and
          content systems. My work centers on creating clarity within complex digital environments — ensuring alignment between
          user experience, institutional strategy, and long-term sustainability.<br><br>          
          As Director of Web Strategy and Digital Experience at Kankakee Community College, I oversee the college's digital
          ecosystem, leading accessibility governance, CMS architecture, analytics, and AI readiness initiatives. My focus is on
          shaping web infrastructure that supports people, protects privacy, and strengthens organizational integrity.</br>
          <br>Across roles — from CMS architect and accessibility advocate to mentor and systems designer — I've guided teams through
          redesigns, policy shifts, and governance transformations. I approach every project through the lens of clarity, ethics,
          and long-term maintainability.
          <br><br>
          I also collaborate with peers across higher ed and nonprofit sectors on emerging challenges: ethical AI adoption,
          summarization accuracy, digital equity, and sustainable governance frameworks that evolve with technology and
          expectations.</br>
