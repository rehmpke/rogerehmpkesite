              <hr class="primary" />
              <p>For over 2 decades I have worked with a variety of teams to design and build sites that address business and user needs. I manage sites in higher ed and have maintained sites in the nutritional supplement industry as well. I strive to
                  create usable, polished and performant products through agile workflow, passionate and deliberate design.</p>
              <p>I live in Kankakee Illinois. I enjoy music, oil painting, and single malt whiskey.</p><br/></div>
