          <p class="about__p">I'm a digital strategist with 25+ years of experience in UX, accessibility, and content systems. My work focuses on structuring clarity into complex web environments — from governance and compliance to performance and user experience.<br><br>
          Currently shaping digital strategy, accessibility, and platform governance at Kankakee Community College — including
          readiness for an AI-driven web, where summarization, misinterpretation, and digital equity are becoming the new
          battleground.<br><br>
          Previously: design lead, CMS architect, accessibility advocate, and mentor to emerging web professionals.<br><br>
          Always open to thoughtful conversations on web clarity, policy-aware systems, and digital infrastructure that protects
          people and mission.</p>

            <ul class="about__ul">
              <li><strong>Strategic clarity</strong> — I help teams connect web infrastructure with operational goals, risk
                considerations, and long-term maintainability.</li>
              <li><strong>Deep technical fluency</strong> — From front-end architecture to CMS customization, I deliver scalable,
                secure, and user-first solutions.</li>
              <li><strong>Proven leadership</strong> — I’ve guided cross-functional teams through major redesigns, accessibility
                audits, <a href="https://www.rogerehmpke.com/#work">platform rebuilds</a>, and system transitions.</li>
              <li><strong>AI-aware structure</strong> — I help shape schema, content structure, and policy alignment to support
                accurate AI summarization, ethical data handling, and improved engagement from search to click.</li>
